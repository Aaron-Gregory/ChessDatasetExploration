# Chess Data Exploration

Welcome to the Chess Data Exploration repository!

This repository contains datasets and code related to feature extraction and analysis performed on a lichess.com dataset, with the end goal of training models for predicting the outcome of chess games.


## What's Included

### 1. Raw Data
- **Chess Games Dataset**: The original dataset comprising chess games from lichess.com. See `README_prompt.md` for more details on this dataset.

### 2. Processed Data
- **Processed Chess Games Dataset**: Derived from the original dataset with engineered features to facilitate machine learning tasks. See `README_result.md` for more details on this dataset.

### 3. Code
- **Python Scripts**: Implementations of data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and basic model fitting.

## How to Get Started

1. **Explore the Data**: Dive into the datasets provided to understand the structure and features available.

2. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the Python scripts to see how the data is processed, features are engineered, and models are evaluated.

3. **Experiment**: Feel free to experiment with different models, feature combinations, and evaluation metrics to enhance predictive performance.


Happy predicting! ðŸŽ‰
